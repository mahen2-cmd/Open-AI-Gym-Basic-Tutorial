# Open AI Gym Basic Tutorial

This tutorial provides a basic introduction to OpenAI Gymnasium, a popular Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

OpenAI Gymnasium provides a collection of environments for developing and testing reinforcement learning algorithms. These environments include classic control tasks, Atari games, and robotics simulations.

To use OpenAI Gymnasium, you can create an environment using the `gym.make()` function, reset the environment using the `reset()` function, and interact with the environment using the `step()` function. The `step()` function takes an action as input and returns the next observation, reward, and termination status.

With this knowledge, you can begin developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms using this powerful library.
